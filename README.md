# MernAuthX
"MernAuthX" is a comprehensive authorization project built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) stack. The project focuses on implementing secure user authentication and authorization functionalities.

The project utilizes React Toast for displaying user notifications in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner. It ensures that users receive important messages and alerts regarding their authentication status, account activities, and system updates.

To effectively manage the application's state, MernAuthX incorporates Redux, a robust state management library. Redux enables efficient and centralized management of the application's data flow, allowing seamless communication between different components and ensuring a consistent user experience.

By combining these technologies, MernAuthX provides a solid foundation for building a secure, scalable, and user-friendly authorization system using the MERN stack.
